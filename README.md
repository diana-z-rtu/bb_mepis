The Backbone Baltic model was upgraded to the Backbone version 3.x to meet current modeling needs within the MEPIS project (“Mitigating Energy Poverty through Innovative Solutions”, No. lzp-2023/1-0214; funded by the Latvian Council of Science).

The initial version of the Backbone Baltic model (1.5v) can be found at https://gitlab.vtt.fi/backbone); the model had structural updates due to the Backone framework significant changes. 

The model was calibrated to reflect 2020 data; the calibration process described in the article: K. Baltputnis, D. Žalostiba, J. Teremranova, P. Pazāns and Z. Broka, "Refinement and Calibration of Optimization Models for Baltic Region Energy System Development," 2024 IEEE 65th International Scientific Conference on Power and Electrical Engineering of Riga Technical University (RTUCON), Riga, Latvia, 2024, pp. 1-6, doi: 10.1109/RTUCON62997.2024.10830801 and the dataset related to the article is published on https://zenodo.org/uploads/14013185.

The model input data contains: InputData_Baltic_2020system.xlsx, InputData_Baltic_2020buildings.xlsx, InputData_Baltic_2020transport.xlsx.
